# Learn Assembly with APIs

[![Learn Assembly with APIs](http://learn.r.ebel.space/assembly)](https://github.com/therebelrobot/learn-x-with-apis)

## Nitty Gritty Details

As you may have guessed by the title of the repo, we're going to build an API. The list of features to include are listed down below. This is by no means a comprehensive or exhaustive list, but represents a good starting point with which to begin your foray into a new programming jungle.

### List of features

- [ ] Basic URL Routing
- [ ] A root level route that provides info about the server (*e.g.* `/` returns `Learning [language] with APIs!`)
- [ ] An endpoint that returns data from an external API
- [ ] An endpoint that returns data from a single local file
- [ ] An endpoint that consumes a json file and dynamically creates more endpoints based on the data
- [ ] An endpoint that returns data from the database of your choice (*e.g.* `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, `Redis`)
- [ ] An endpoint that returns static assets from a directory (*e.g.* `/static/index.html`, `/static/style.css`, `/static/app.js`)
- [ ] An endpoint that takes parameters and does a calculation (*e.g* `/add/2/3` returns `5`)

### Things to remember

- You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Look for popular libraries that accomplish what you're trying to do. Low level solutions are fun to make, and teach a lot, but can sometimes be more complex than is necessary for just getting started
- Research and utilize package management systems. Package managers (*e.g* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) or [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/)) are generally a good place to find and include additional libraries for your application. 
- Look at other repos in this language, and see if there is a consistent style to the language. Do most devs use 2 or 4 space indentation? Tabs or spaces? You won't get everything right the first try, but it's worth taking a look at.
- Ask for help. StackOverflow, Google, that guy you met that one time at that conference, all can be excellent assets to accomplish your goal.
